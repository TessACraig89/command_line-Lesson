## Let's take another glance at the command line to sharpen our knowledge!

### ... but first let’s clarify a few terms.

- **Console:** This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.

- **Command Line:** This is the actual line in a console where you type your command.

- **Prompt:** This is the beginning of the command line. It usually provides some contextual information like who you are, where you are and other useful info. It typically ends in a $ . After the prompt is where you will be typing commands.

- **Terminal:** This is the actual interface to the console. The program we use to interact with the console is actually a “terminal emulator”, providing us the experience of typing into an old school terminal from the convenience of our modern graphical operating system.

- **Language:** As a terminal emulator, the application provides text-based access to the operating system, in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of macOS, by providing a command line interface to the operating system when used in conjunction with a Unix shell, such as bash, this is the default shell in Mac OS X Jaguar and later.

- **Shell:** The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter. A shell usually implies an interface with a command syntax.


## Alright! So let's get started!

### For today's exercise we're going to perform a little home improvement with `My_House`

</p>

- This is a directory structure is located in this repo. I'll be using it to demonstrate this lesson
- To start this project, we're going to need a blue print! ```brew install tree```

- Once you download this tool and enter the command: `tree`, you'll get an output like this:

</p>

- Let's look at some other tools in our tool belt:
  * **The infamous `ls`, or _list_.**
    - This command can accept arguments such as `-a`, or `-l`.
  * **The marvellous `mv` or _move_.**
    - This command allows you to move or rename directories and files.
  * **The capricious `cp` or _copy_.**
    - This command will allow you to copy a file onto another file.
  * **The ravenous `rm` | `rm -rf` or _remove_**
    - This command allows you to delete a file or directory of files respectively.
  * **The curious `cat`, or _display contents_**
    - This command will display the contents of a file.
  * **The historic `history` or _history_**
    - This command will display a history of your last commands.


## Time to get started, but first we need to clean the house up a bit.
#### Here's the rule, all commands need to be performed from the property Directory
- How can we create files or directories inside of other directories without `cd`'ing into them first?
- We'll need to let the dog outside. How can we do that will one command?
- The TV Remote is inside the bedroom. Where should we move it to?
- How can we remove the bicycle from the living room and put it in the garage?
- Let's put the groceries up. What's the most efficient way to do that?
- Let's add a closet to our bedroom
- Let's change the name of our bedroom to `master_bedroom` and build a `guest_bedroom`

## Whew! :sweat_smile:
